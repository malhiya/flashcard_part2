## Notes
* I had trouble with understanding event handler functon from class. I looked at the resources that codePath gave and looking at resources on Goodle helped me have a better understanding. 
* A challenge I had was changing the color of the input box to indicate whether the user guess was right or wrong. I used chatGPT to know how to change the input class. It gave me the setInputClass function which I ended up using and it worked.
* I also had trouble with my h1 where the top half of the text cut off. I asked chatGPT what the problem was and I found out that I needed to change my height for the body to min-height.
